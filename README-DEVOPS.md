Developers want to deploy code on the cloud without concern to acquiring the infrastructure every time they create a new project.   This is a major benefit to Cloud and serverless technologies.  Serverless technologies also also allow developers to scale applications to Zero to reduce worries about wasting the underlying infrastructure cost when there is no user activity and to scale up when there is user activity.

Leveraging an Infrastructure as Code model with infrastructure deployed via GITOps.

## AWS Copilot 

AWS Copilot is a command line tool that allows developers to deploy applications to AWS ECS and AWS Fargate.  It includes features to integrate with AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild to deploy applications to AWS ECS and AWS Fargate.

It's pretty simple to setup a CI/CD pipeline with AWS Copilot.  See this reference:
