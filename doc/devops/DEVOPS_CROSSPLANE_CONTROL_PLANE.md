Crossplane is a Kubernetes add-on that allows you to manage cloud infrastructure using Kubernetes.  

Create a control plane on [minikube](../../infrastructure/k8s/minikube/gettingStarted-minikube.md) 

Use case: create test accounts automatically for development and demo environments and destroy them when they are no longer needed
