At present, I'm considering a start by looking at Hashicorp Vault
https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials 

As things evolve, I'll continue this exploration and most likely this will include other secrets managers as well.  For example, on AWS I'm going to look into using AWS Secrets Manager.  I like "a cloud guru" as a means to explore and exercise new tools.
