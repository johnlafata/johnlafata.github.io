# Observability for Gen AI applications



Observability for GEN AI applications enables developers to gain insights into the performance and behavior of their AI models in real-time. 

By monitoring and tracing the various integrations and workflows involved in Gen AI applications, developers can ensure the reliability, efficiency, and accuracy of their models. Observability also allows for the identification of potential issues or bottlenecks, facilitating proactive troubleshooting and optimization. Overall, incorporating robust observability practices is essential for maintaining the quality and effectiveness of Gen AI applications in today's dynamic and complex technological landscape.

## Arize Pheonix
Phoenix provides tracing and span analysis capabilities. It is useful during the prototyping and debugging stages as it allows teams to gain detailed insights into the execution flow of the application. This capability makes it easier to identify and resolve issues by providing access to performance metrics, logs, and metadata, ultimately streamlining debugging efforts.

## Langtrace
Langtrace is an open-source observability tool designed to help users collect and analyze traces to enhance their LLM applications. It consists of an SDK, which is a lightweight library that can be integrated into projects to gather traces, and a dashboard where users can visualize and analyze these traces. Langtrace focuses on optimizing observability for LLM applications in terms of usage, accuracy, and performance metrics like latency and success rate.

The most common use cases for Langtrace include monitoring LLM usage such as token and costs, latency, and success rate, evaluating the responses of LLM to measure the accuracy of LLM apps, and creating and managing datasets and prompt sets for LLM apps.
