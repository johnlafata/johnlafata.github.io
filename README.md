# Planting Roots

As a cloud architect, I'm passionate about building scalable and efficient systems that can adapt to changing business needs.

This repo is where I'll share my thoughts and experience as a cloud architect.   I'm gradually going to release projects, experiments, and learnings here.  

Some sample topics may include containerizing a web application, deploying a new application, migrating code to a cloud ready architecture, or automating infrastructure provisioning, this repo is where I'll document my experiences, successes, and failures along the way.
