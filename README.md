# Developer Experience Workshop
This repo presents tasks undertaken to identify and document best practices for developing, deploying, and managing applications.  The goal is to provide a guide to follow when working on new application development projects.

The tasks are intended to reflect real-world problems such as containerizing a legacy application, deploying an inference application to the cloud, migrating code to a cloud ready architecture, or automating infrastructure provisioning.   

The tasks are organized into the following categories:

## Application Development
Some sample applications.
