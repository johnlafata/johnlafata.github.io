## Hosting a GPU in a hypervisor using Linux with KVM

When deploying GPUs in hypervisors using Linux with KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), several advantages arise that enhance the performance, scalability, and flexibility of virtualized environments. Below is a summary of key points from the NVIDIA vGPU release notes for Linux with KVM, followed by the benefits of deploying GPUs in such setups.

### Summary of key points from the NVIDIA vGPU release notes for Linux with KVM:

1. **NVIDIA vGPU Software Overview**: NVIDIA's virtual GPU (vGPU) software allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to share GPU resources, providing the benefits of GPU acceleration for numerous applications, such as AI, data science, and graphics rendering.

2. **Supported Versions**: The release notes cover NVIDIA vGPU Software versions 13.0 through 13.12. Each version includes a specific set of drivers for both the NVIDIA Virtual GPU Manager and the guest VM, ensuring compatibility and functionality.

3. **Compatibility Requirements**: It's crucial to use compatible versions of the NVIDIA vGPU Manager and guest VM drivers. Incompatibility can prevent the vGPU from loading properly. The notes emphasize that all releases within the same branch (13.x) are generally compatible, but mixing branches may lead to issues.

4. **License System**: All releases in this family require the use of the NVIDIA License System, as the older vGPU license server has been deprecated.

5. **Feature Support and Limitations**: When using different versions of the vGPU Manager and guest VM drivers, the combination supports only features and hardware compatible with both releases. An example given is the lack of support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 in certain configurations.

6. **Focus Areas**: The documentation includes a wide range of application areas supported by vGPUs, such as AR/VR, cybersecurity, edge computing, data center and cloud applications, generative AI, and more. This highlights the versatility and broad application potential of vGPUs.

7. **Updates and Enhancements**: Each release may include bug fixes, performance improvements, and new feature support, which are detailed in the individual release notes.

By addressing these points, NVIDIA's vGPU technology enhances the functionality and performance of virtualized environments.

### Deploying GPUs in hypervisors using Linux with KVM offers several benefits:

1. **Resource Optimization**: By virtualizing GPUs, multiple virtual machines (VMs) can share GPU resources. This improves resource utilization and can lead to cost savings, as fewer physical GPUs are needed to support multiple workloads.

2. **Scalability**: Virtual GPU (vGPU) technology allows for easy scaling of GPU resources. As demand increases, additional virtual GPUs can be provisioned without the need for additional physical hardware.

3. **Flexibility**: vGPUs provide the flexibility to allocate GPU resources dynamically based on workload requirements. This means you can adjust GPU power according to the specific needs of different applications or users.

4. **Enhanced Performance**: GPUs can accelerate a wide range of applications, including AI, machine learning, scientific simulations, and graphics rendering. Virtualizing these resources ensures that VMs can leverage GPU acceleration for improved performance.

5. **Isolation and Security**: KVM, as a hypervisor, provides strong isolation between VMs. This ensures that different users or workloads can share the same physical GPU without compromising security or performance.

6. **Support for Diverse Workloads**: With NVIDIA vGPU, diverse workloads ranging from AR/VR, data center, and cloud applications to data science and AI can be supported. This versatility makes it suitable for various industries and use cases.

7. **Cost Efficiency**: By maximizing the usage of existing hardware and reducing the need for additional physical GPUs, organizations can achieve significant cost efficiencies.

8. **Centralized Management**: Deploying GPUs within a virtualized environment allows for centralized management of both compute and graphics resources, simplifying IT operations and maintenance.

9. **Compatibility with Modern Applications**: The vGPU technology supports modern operating systems and applications, ensuring that businesses can keep up with technological advancements without major overhauls.
