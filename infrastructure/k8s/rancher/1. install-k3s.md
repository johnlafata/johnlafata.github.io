# Documentation for Installing Rancher K3s on a Linux Node

## Prerequisites
- A Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)
- Root or sudo access to the Linux node
- Internet connectivity to download necessary packages

## Steps to Install Rancher K3s

1. **Update the System:**
    Ensure your system is up-to-date by running the following commands:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    ```

2. **Install K3s:**
    Run the following command to install K3s:
    ```sh
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
    ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
    Check the status of the K3s service to ensure it is running:
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl status k3s
    ```

4. **Access K3s Cluster:**
    By default, the `kubectl` configuration file is located at `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml`. You can use this file to interact with your K3s cluster:
    ```sh
    export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

5. **Optional - Install `kubectl`:**
    If `kubectl` is not installed on your system, you can install it by following these steps:
    ```sh
    curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
    chmod +x ./kubectl
    sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    ```
