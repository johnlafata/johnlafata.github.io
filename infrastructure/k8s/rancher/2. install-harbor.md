# Documentation for Installing Harbor on k3s

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing Harbor, an open-source container image registry, on a k3s Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- A running k3s cluster
- `kubectl` command-line tool configured to interact with your k3s cluster
- Helm package manager installed

## Steps

1. **Add the Harbor Helm repository:**

    ```sh
    helm repo add harbor https://helm.goharbor.io
    helm repo update
    ```

2. **Create a namespace for Harbor:**

    ```sh
    kubectl create namespace harbor
    ```

3. **Install Harbor using Helm:**

    ```sh
    helm install harbor harbor/harbor --namespace harbor
    ```

4. **Verify the installation:**

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n harbor
    ```

    Ensure all Harbor components are running.

5. **Access Harbor:**

    By default, Harbor will be exposed as a service within the cluster. You can access it using the service's external IP or configure an ingress for external access.

6. **Configure Harbor:**

    - Open a web browser and navigate to the Harbor UI.
    - Log in with the default credentials (`admin` / `Harbor12345`).
    - Change the default password and configure Harbor according to your requirements.

## Additional Configuration

- **TLS/SSL:** For production environments, configure TLS/SSL for secure communication.
- **Persistence:** Configure persistent storage for Harbor data to ensure data durability.

Refer to the [official Harbor documentation](https://goharbor.io/docs/) for more detailed configuration options and advanced usage.

## Troubleshooting

- Check the logs of Harbor components if you encounter issues:

  ```sh
  kubectl logs -n harbor <pod-name>
  ```

- Ensure all required services are running and accessible.

This completes the installation of Harbor on a k3s cluster.
