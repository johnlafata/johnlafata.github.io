1. **Enabling Workload Management - Deploying a supervisor**: Use the vSphere Client to create a supservisor on the stretched cluster. 

    * [Deploying a One zone Supervisor with vDS networking stack](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/8-0/installing-and-configuring-vsphere-supervisor/deploy-a-one-zone-supervisor/deploy-a-supervisor-with-vds-networking.html)

    The deployment process involves creating a Supervisor Cluster, which serves as the control plane for managing Kubernetes clusters. The Supervisor Cluster is deployed on the vSAN stretched cluster, leveraging its high availability and resilience features.

    The deployment process includes configuring the Supervisor Cluster to use the vSAN stretched cluster as the underlying storage, ensuring that all Kubernetes workloads benefit from the stretched cluster's capabilities.
