# vSphere kubernetes deployments on vSAN streteched cluster

Over the last few months, I've been involved in two separate projects to deploy Kubernetes clusters on a vSAN stretched cluster using vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS). This blog entry aims to capture the highlights of these efforts for running Kubernetes workloads in this highly available environment.

## Key Considerations
When deploying Kubernetes on a vSAN stretched cluster, several key considerations must be taken into account:

1. **High Availability**: Ensure that the Kubernetes control plane and etcd are highly available across the stretched cluster.
2. **Networking**: Configure networking to support cross-site communication between Kubernetes nodes.
3. **Storage**: Leverage vSAN's capabilities to provide resilient storage for Kubernetes workloads.
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Implement disaster recovery strategies to protect against site failures.

## Deployment Steps
The deployment process involves several key steps:

1. **Prepare the vSAN Stretched Cluster**: Ensure that the vSAN stretched cluster is properly configured and that all necessary components are in place.

    vSAN stretched clusters are a powerful option for environments that require the highest levels of data resilience and VM uptime. This guide was developed to provide additional insight and information for the design, installation and configuration of vSAN stretched clusters. It will also cover operational procedures and explain how it handles failure scenarios unique to this topology.

    A VMware vSAN stretched cluster is a cluster configuration where the hosts that comprise a vSAN cluster reside in two geographic locations. The two sites typically have an equal number of hosts residing in each site, and are connected using a high bandwidth/low latency connection known as an inter-site link, or ISL. The third site, or tertiary site hosts a vSAN Witness Host that is connected to both data sites. This connectivity can be via low bandwidth/high latency links.

2. **Review the Pre-requisites**: Ensure that the vSphere environment meets the prerequisites for deploying VKS, including the necessary licenses and configurations.

In addition to the networks components being setup, VKS requires a load balancer solution to be installed and configured for the Kubernetes control plane and workloads. This can be achieved using either NSX advanced load balancer (a.k.a. Avi Load Balancer) or HAProxy.


AVI load balancer can be used with both vDS network and with NSX.  NSX is also a supported as a network provider for VKS, but it's not going to be covered in detail here.  The Avi Load Balancer is the recommended solution for VKS deployments.
