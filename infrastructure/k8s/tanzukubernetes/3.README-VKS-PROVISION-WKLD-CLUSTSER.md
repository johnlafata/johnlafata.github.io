# Provisioning Workload Clusters

1. **Provision a workload Cluster**: After deploying the Supervisor Cluster, you can create and manage Kubernetes workload clusters using the vSphere Client or CLI tools.

    * [Create a Workload Cluster](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/8-0/installing-and-configuring-vsphere-supervisor/create-a-workload-cluster.html)

    This step involves defining the configuration for the workload cluster, including the number of nodes, resource allocation, and network settings. The workload cluster is then provisioned on the vSAN stretched cluster, allowing it to take advantage of the underlying infrastructure's high availability and performance features.

2. **Configure Kubernetes Networking**: Set up networking to enable communication between Kubernetes nodes across sites.

    When using Avi Load Balancer, install Avi Kubernetes Operator and configure it to manage the load balancer for the Kubernetes control plane and workloads. This ensures that traffic is properly routed across the stretched cluster.

    When using HA proxy, configure the HAProxy Load Balancer to support service type LoadBalancer in Kubernetes. This involves:

    * Deploy the HAProxy Kubernetes Ingress Controller as a DaemonSet or Deployment
    * Configure a service of type LoadBalancer that points to the HAProxy pods
    * Create a ConfigMap with the HAProxy configuration for load balancing across sites
    * The HAProxy configuration should include proper timeouts and retries to accommodate potential latency between sites in the stretched cluster.


    Ensure proper health checks are configured to detect failures between sites

    Apply network policies to allow traffic between the HAProxy instances and Kubernetes services


3. **Deploy Workloads**: Deploy Kubernetes workloads and services, taking advantage of the stretched cluster's capabilities.

    CI/CD solutions that leverage gitOps principles can be used to automate the deployment of Kubernetes workloads. This includes using tools like ArgoCD or Flux to manage the deployment process and ensure that the desired state of the cluster is maintained.
