# Using  AWS Copilot to deploy to Fargate

### prerequisites
- ensure that you have an ECR registry in AWS
- AWS CLI installed
- Docker Desktop installed
- AWS copilot installed
- non root account AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET in AWS Profile
  - instructions: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html 
  - for example: create an alternate IAM user via the console, 
```
export AWS_PROFILE=my-app
```
- OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GROQ_API_KEY in .env file
- also in the .env file, set OLLAMA_INCLUDED=False [this code only supports Ollama from local workspace at present]


### Usage
These are the basic stages to fargate deployment with AWS copilot

This is a good reference: https://aosolorzano.medium.com/spring-boot-native-microservice-on-ecs-fargate-using-aws-copilot-cli-for-cross-account-deployment-73b1836f21f7

This one is one that incorporates cognito

`copilot init` to create the app

`copilot svc init` to create the service

`copilot env init` to create the environment

`copilot app deploy` to deploy the app to the environment

You can pass the parameters in the command line if you want as follows, when prompted to create the environment, say no.

```
copilot init                                   \
  --app          planning                      \
  --name         planning                      \
  --type         'Load Balanced Web Service'   \
  --dockerfile   './Dockerfile'                \
  --port         7860                          \
  --tag          '1.0.0'
```

Response:
```
Note: It's best to run this command in the root of your Git repository.
Welcome to the Copilot CLI! We're going to walk you through some questions
to help you get set up with a containerized application on AWS. An application is a collection of
containerized services that operate together.

Ok great, we'll set up a Load Balanced Web Service named planning in application planning.

- Creating the infrastructure for stack planning-infrastructure-roles                           [create complete]  [44.2s]
  - A StackSet admin role assumed by CloudFormation to manage regional stacks                   [create complete]  [19.4s]

âœ” The directory copilot will hold service manifests for application planning.

Note: Architecture type arm64 has been detected. We will set platform 'linux/x86_64' instead. If you'd rather build and run as architecture type arm64, please change the 'platform' field in your workload manifest to 'linux/arm64'.
âœ” Wrote the manifest for service planning at copilot/planning/manifest.yml
Your manifest contains configurations like your container size and port.

- Update regional resources with stack set "planning-infrastructure"  [succeeded]  [0.0s]
All right, you're all set for local development.
Deploy: No

No problem, you can deploy your service later:
- Run `copilot env init` to create your environment.
- Run `copilot deploy` to deploy your service.

### create environment

Use the appropriate AWS Profile for your configuration in the following

```
copilot env init              \
  --app 'planning'            \
  --name 'qa'                  \
  --profile 'fargate-sandbox'         \
  --container-insights          \
  --default-config
```
Response:
```
âœ” Wrote the manifest for environment qa at copilot/environments/qa/manifest.yml

- Update regional resources with stack set "planning-infrastructure"  [succeeded]           [39.0s]
  - Update resources in region "us-east-1"                            [create complete]     [40.6s]
    - KMS key to encrypt pipeline artifacts between stages            [create complete]     [19.4s]
    - ECR container image repository for "planning"                   [create complete]     [0.0s]
    - S3 Bucket to store local artifacts                              [create in progress]  [3.3s]
âœ” Proposing infrastructure changes for the planning-qa environment.
- Creating the infrastructure for the planning-qa environment.  [create complete]  [43.0s]
  - An IAM Role for AWS CloudFormation to manage resources      [create complete]  [20.1s]
  - An IAM Role to describe resources in your environment       [create complete]  [19.5s]
âœ” Provisioned bootstrap resources for environment qa in region us-east-1 under application planning.
Recommended follow-up actions:
  - Update your manifest copilot/environments/qa/manifest.yml to change the defaults.
  - Run `copilot env deploy --name qa` to deploy your environment.
```


## deploy the env, the --no-rollback is useful to help debug any problems if it fails, but it's optional

```
copilot env deploy      \
  --app planning        \
  --name qa              \
  --no-rollback
```
