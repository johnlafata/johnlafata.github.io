# configure OIDC

When configuring OpenID Connect (OIDC), key parameters include the client ID, client secret, redirect URI, scope, and response type, along with optional parameters like state and nonce for security. 

Here's a more detailed explanation of these parameters:
Required Parameters:

**client_id:**
A unique identifier for your application, obtained from the OpenID Connect provider. 

**response_type:**
Specifies the type of response expected from the authorization server. For basic authorization code flow, this should be code. 

**redirect_uri:**
The URL where the user will be redirected after authentication, also known as the callback URL. 

**scope:**
Defines the permissions your application is requesting. For OpenID Connect, the openid scope is required, and you can request additional scopes like email or profile. 

Optional Parameters:
state:
An opaque value used to protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. The client generates this value and sends it to the authorization server, and the authorization server returns it in the callback. 
nonce:
A value used to prevent replay attacks of the ID token. The client generates this value and sends it to the authorization server, and the authorization server includes it in the ID token. 

client_secret:
A secret key used to authenticate your application to the authorization server. 

token_endpoint_url:
The URL of the token endpoint, where you request access tokens. 

signature_algorithm:
Specifies the signature algorithm used for signing the ID token. 

authorization_endpoint:
The URL of the authorization endpoint, where the user initiates the authentication process. 

userinfo_endpoint:
The URL of the user info endpoint, where you can retrieve user information. 
jwks_uri:
The URL of the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint, where you can retrieve the public keys used to verify the signatures of the tokens.
