To connect to Ops Manager from a bastion host, you'll typically use SSH (Secure Shell) to connect to the bastion host first, and then SSH from the bastion host to the Ops Manager host. Alternatively, you can use tools like PuTTY to set up SSH tunneling for more complex connections. 
Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Establish SSH Connection to Bastion Host:
Open a terminal or SSH client (like PuTTY). 
Connect to the bastion host using SSH. You'll need the public IP address or hostname of the bastion host, your username, and potentially your private key. 
Example SSH command: ssh -i /path/to/your/private/key username@bastion_host_ip 

2. Connect from Bastion Host to Ops Manager:
From the SSH session on the bastion host, SSH into the Ops Manager host. You'll need the Ops Manager host's private IP address, username, and potentially your private key.
Example SSH command (from inside the bastion host): ssh -i /path/to/your/private/key username@ops_manager_ip 

3. Alternative: Using PuTTY for SSH Tunneling:
Open PuTTY.
Under Session, enter the public IP address of the bastion host and port 22.
Under SSH > Auth, specify your private key.
Under SSH > Tunnels, enable "Forward local port" and specify the destination port for the Ops Manager host.
Connect to the bastion host.

You can now connect to the Ops Manager host via the local port you configured in PuTTY. 
Important Considerations:
Security Groups/Firewalls:
Ensure that your security groups or firewalls allow SSH traffic between the bastion host and the Ops Manager host. 
Private Keys:
You'll need the private key associated with the SSH keys used to connect to both the bastion and Ops Manager hosts. 
User Permissions:
Make sure the user account you're using on the bastion host has the necessary permissions to connect to the Ops Manager host. 
Bastion Host as a Single Point of Failure:
Consider the implications of a single bastion host, especially in production environments. You might want to implement redundancy by having multiple bastion hosts or exploring alternative solutions like AWS Session Manager or Azure Bastion.
