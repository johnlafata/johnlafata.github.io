To connect to the BOSH API from a jump host and authenticate with UAA, you need to first set up a UAA client with the necessary permissions, then use that client to obtain an access token, and finally, configure your BOSH CLI to use that token for authentication. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. Set up a UAA Client:
Access Operations Manager:
Navigate to the Tanzu Operations Manager UI and find the BOSH Director tile.
Locate UAA Credentials:

In the "Credentials" tab, find the "UAA Login Client Credentials" and "Uaa Admin User Credentials".

Create a Client:
Use the Broadcom TechDocs instructions to create a new UAA client with bosh.admin privileges.

Note Client ID and Secret:
Make note of the client_id and secret you created for this client, as you'll need them in the next steps. 
2. Obtain an Access Token:
Target UAA:
Use the uaac command to target the UAA server: uaac target uaa.<your-uaa-domain> --skip-ssl-validation.
Get a Client Token:
Use the uaac command to get a client token: uaac token client get <your_client_id>.
Note Access Token:
The output will include an access token. Keep this token safe, as it's used for authentication.

3. Configure BOSH CLI:
Set BOSH Environment Variables:
Set the BOSH_CLIENT and BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET environment variables to the UAA client credentials you created earlier.
Set BOSH Director Alias:
Use bosh alias-env MY-ENVIRONMENT-NAME -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --ca-cert /path/to/ca_cert to set an alias for your BOSH environment.
Test Connection:
Use bosh target and bosh info to verify that you can connect to the BOSH Director using the UAA credentials. 
4. Jump Host Authentication (If applicable):
If connecting from a jump host, ensure SSH access to the jump host is established and that the necessary firewall rules are in place to allow traffic between the jump host and the BOSH Director.
You may need to use the ssh command to connect to the jump host and then use the BOSH CLI commands from within the jump host session. 
Important Notes:
Replace <your-uaa-domain> with the actual UAA domain of your BOSH deployment. 
Ensure that the BOSH CLI is installed and configured correctly on the jump host. 
Always use secure practices when handling UAA credentials and access tokens. 
Refer to the Broadcom TechDocs and Cloud Foundry BOSH documentation for more detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips.
