The CF_DEBUG environment variable in the Cloud Foundry CLI can be used to enable debug logging for troubleshooting issues. Setting it to true (or any non-empty value) will provide more detailed output to help identify problems, according to the official Cloud Foundry documentation. 
How to use CF_DEBUG:
Set the environment variable: Before using the CLI, set the CF_DEBUG environment variable. For example, in Linux/macOS:
Code

    export CF_DEBUG=true
or in Windows:
Code

    $env:CF_DEBUG = "true"
1. Run the CLI commands:
Execute your Cloud Foundry CLI commands as usual. The output will now include more verbose debugging information.
2. Review the output:
Examine the logs for clues about the issue you are encountering. You might see API requests, responses, and internal state changes. 
3. Turn off debugging:
To disable debugging, either remove the CF_DEBUG variable or set it to an empty value (e.g., export CF_DEBUG=). 
Example:
If you are using cf push, enabling CF_DEBUG might reveal details about the app's deployment process, such as which buildpack was used, the staging process, or any errors encountered during the build or launch stages, as explained in the Cloud Foundry Docs. 
Other debugging techniques:
API Tracing:
.
For API tracing, use CF_TRACE=true or the -v option, according to the Cloud Foundry Docs. This option is useful for understanding the flow of commands and API calls.
Trace to File:
.
You can also trace to a file instead of the terminal. This can be helpful for analyzing log data in more detail, as described in the Cloud Foundry Docs.
-v option:
.
The -v option provides verbose output, according to the Cloud Foundry Docs. This can be useful for identifying the exact sequence of actions performed by the CLI. 
By leveraging the CF_DEBUG environment variable and other debugging techniques, you can gain valuable insights into the behavior of the Cloud Foundry CLI and troubleshoot various issues more effectively.
