To generate a FastAPI program from an OpenAPI specification, one can utilize tools or libraries designed for this purpose. Below are the steps and an example using the openapi-to-fastapi library.

###  Install openapi-to-fastapi:
Open a terminal and run:
Code
```
     pip install openapi-to-fastapi
```

### Prepare OpenAPI Specification:

Ensure you have a valid OpenAPI specification file (e.g., openapi.yaml or openapi.json).
Generate FastAPI Code:
Use the openapi-to-fastapi command-line tool or library to generate the FastAPI code.
Using the command-line tool:
Code
```
     openapi-to-fastapi --input openapi.yaml --output app.py
```

This command will generate a FastAPI application in app.py based on the openapi.yaml specification. Using as a library.
