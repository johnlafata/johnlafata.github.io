# My Journey with Vibe-Coding: Why GitHub Copilot Became My Go-To Development Partner

A practical exploration of AI-assisted development and why GitHub Copilot's multi-model approach offers the best value for pair programming

## What is Vibe-Coding?
Over the past few months, I've been exploring what is referred to in the software development world as "vibe-coding" - a development approach that feels less like traditional programming and more like having a conversation with an intelligent pair programmer. It's that sweet spot where you describe what you want, the AI understands the context, and together you iterate toward a solution.

Think of it as paired programming, but your pair:

* Never gets tired
* Has read millions of code repositories
* Can switch between multiple AI models depending on the task
* Costs a fraction of a human developer's time

## The Cost-Effectiveness Revelation
Here's what surprised me most: GitHub Copilot with premium model access is significantly more cost-effective than using Claude Code or other standalone AI coding tools.

## The Math That Matters

I haven't taken the time to do a detailed cost analysis, my experience with Copilot vs. Claude-based is based on the observation of my usage at Anthropic using Cloud-code vs the fixed cost of Copilot with premium model access.

The key insight: GitHub Copilot gives you access to multiple premium models (including Claude 4.5 Sonnet) for a fixed fee if you can stay within the premium request allotment.   If you need more premium requests than the allotment, you can enable usage-based pricing to cover the overage.   This is in contrast to Claude Code where you pay per request and the cost can add up quickly for complex coding tasks.

## Real Projects, Real Results
Let me walk you through the actual projects where vibe-coding with Copilot proved its worth.

### Project 1: Product ROI Analysis System
The Challenge: Build a LangGraph-based application that analyzes products using LLMs, gathers context from multiple sources (web, documents, videos, GitHub repos), stores embeddings in ChromaDB, and calculates ROI.

The Vibe-Coding Experience:

I started with a markdown document describing the requirements and told Copilot:

```
#new create a Python application that implements a product ROI analysis system
using LangGraph. It should support multiple LLM providers (Anthropic Claude, 
OpenAI GPT), gather context from various sources, use ChromaDB for vector 
storage, and integrate with S3 for persistence.
```

What Copilot Generated:

Complete project structure in seconds:

```

├── src/
│   ├── config/         # Configuration management
│   ├── models/         # Pydantic data models
│   ├── graph/          # LangGraph workflow nodes
│   ├── services/       # Core business logic

├── tests/              # Test framework
├── .env.example        # Environment template
└── requirements.txt    # Dependencies
```

Core data models with proper type hints:

```
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from uuid import UUID
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Optional

class Product(BaseModel):
    id: UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid4)
    name: str = Field(..., max_length=255)
    description: Optional[str] = None
    price: float = Field(..., gt=0)
    tags: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
```

LLM service integration supporting multiple providers:

```
class LLMService:
    def __init__(self, provider: str = "anthropic"):
        self.provider = provider
        if provider == "anthropic":
            self.client = Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))
        elif provider == "openai":
            self.client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
```

#### The Iteration Process:

The beauty of vibe-coding showed up in the refinement phase. When I needed to add web scraping capabilities:

Me: "Add a web scraping service that can extract content from URLs and store it in the context"

Copilot: Generated a complete WebScraperService with BeautifulSoup integration, rate limiting, and error handling.

Me: "The scraper needs to handle JavaScript-rendered content"

Copilot: Switched the implementation to use Playwright, added async support, and updated the tests.

This back-and-forth felt natural - like explaining requirements to a junior developer who learns incredibly fast.

### Project 2: Conway's Game of Life
The Challenge: I remembered this classic cellular automaton and wanted to build a web-based version.

The Prompt:
```
Create a Python application that implements Conway's Game of Life with a 
web interface. Use a grid where cells can be alive or dead, and implement 
the standard rules for cell evolution.
```

What Happened:

Copilot generated:

* A Flask web server
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend with canvas rendering
* The game logic with proper state management
* Controls for play/pause, speed adjustment, and pattern presets

Time to working prototype: About 15 minutes, including tweaks.

### Project 3: Maze Game for My Granddaughter

This project really showcased the "vibe" in vibe-coding.

The Prompt:

```
Create a Python application that implements a maze game. Use a smiley face 
icon to represent the player and trace their path in a blue line. Allow the 
player to specify maze size from 20x20 to 80x80. The maze must have a start 
and endpoint connected by a complex network of paths with dead ends and loops.
```

The Experience:

Copilot understood the intent - this wasn't just about generating a maze, it was about creating something fun for a child. It generated:

* A maze generator using recursive backtracking
* A Pygame-based UI with smooth animations
* A path-tracing system that draws as the player moves
* Difficulty settings that adjust maze complexity

The Refinement:

Me: "Make the smiley face bigger and add sound effects when hitting walls"

Copilot: Updated the sprite rendering and added pygame.mixer integration with appropriate sound files.

Me: "Add a 'breadcrumb' mode where the player can mark their path"

Copilot: Implemented a toggle system with visual markers and keyboard shortcuts.

This felt like pair programming at its best - I provided the creative direction, Copilot handled the implementation details.

## The Multi-Model Advantage
Here's where GitHub Copilot's approach really shines: access to multiple premium models through a single interface.

When I Use Different Models

Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via Copilot):

Complex architectural decisions
Refactoring large codebases
Writing comprehensive documentation
Debugging subtle logic errors
GPT-4 (via Copilot):

Quick code generation
Writing unit tests
API integration code
Boilerplate generation
o1 (via Copilot):

Algorithm optimization
Complex mathematical logic
Performance-critical code
Security-sensitive implementations
Gemini (via Copilot):

Multi-language projects
Data transformation tasks
Pattern matching and regex
Configuration file generation
The Cost Comparison in Practice
Let me break down a real scenario from the Product ROI Analysis project:

Task: Implement a web scraping service with JavaScript rendering, rate limiting, error handling, and content extraction.

Using Claude Code directly:

Cost: ~$0.50 for the conversation (multiple iterations)
Time: 45 minutes
Context switches: 3 (between IDE and Claude interface)

Using GitHub Copilot with Claude 3.5:

Cost: Included in $29/month subscription
Time: 20 minutes
Context switches: 0 (all in VS Code)
Multiply this across dozens of features: The savings become substantial
