# Spring Security
Spring Security is a framework that offers authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks. It provides support for securing both imperative and reactive applications, making it the standard choice for securing Spring-based applications.

Spring Security can be utilized to provide application authentication and authorization throughout various stages of the software development lifecycle. It offers support for securing both imperative and reactive applications, making it suitable for different development approaches. By integrating Spring Security into the application, developers can implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities and authorization controls to manage access to resources. This ensures that applications are protected against unauthorized access and potential security threats at every stage of development and deployment.
