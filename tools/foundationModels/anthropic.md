Using Anthropic is pretty simple, you need to register with anthropic to get an api key, then you can use the Anthropic langchain python library to interact with the api.   

I put a nominal charge on my Anthropic account to get started and I'm going to be careful to monitor my usage so I don't overrun the allocation I committed.
